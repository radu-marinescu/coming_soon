# Coming soon page
### .htaccess redirect with ?pass=1234 bypass

## Instalation
Copy everything into your website's root directory. If you want to change the password, edit `coming_soon/index.ph[` file. DO NOT use a sensitive password, since it is going to be seen in plain text in browser's history.

## Access
To access the actual website's content, type `?pass=yourpassword` in the address bar, right after the `/coming_soon/` part of the URL.

Eg.
'''
https://domain.com/coming_soon?pass=1234
'''
